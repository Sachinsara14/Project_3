# Project_3
Visualize the relationship between DNA fragment size and genomic position. This tool generates a "Long Form" matrix from raw sequencing data (BED format) and visualizes the fragment length distribution as a heatmap. It is designed to handle massive genomic datasets by streaming data and using memory-efficient plotting techniques.
